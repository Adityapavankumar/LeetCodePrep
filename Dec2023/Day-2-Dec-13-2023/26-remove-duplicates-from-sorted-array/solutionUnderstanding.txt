Here, it was given that the list has already been sorted in ascending order.
That means the current element must be greater than the previous element if the previous element does exist.

We iterate through the array. For every element in array (after the first) we check if it is greater than the (i-1)th element, if it is we keep adding it to the list while incrementing i.

Here i is the count of elements in the array if all elements are unique, we use it as the iterator.
